**Run**

To run this project, download it to your computer and open it with a code editor. Open the `.env` file in the env folder and firstly give it into `MONGO_URL` information. MONGO_URL gets database connect link. Like that:

`MONGO_URL = mydatabaseconnectlinkexample@mongodb`

You should enter other information in the `.env` file for token and password reset operations. You can find this information at the end of this document under the name "env file". But it's not must for now.

Then you should download the packages that this project depends on from the terminal with the `npm install` command. Dependencies of this project:

When you want to reach certain routes, middleware decodes this token and if the token is valid, it allows you to switch to the route. If you want to test this project in an API Testing tool, you should send token information in headers in route requests. Like that:

`Bearer: {{access_token}}`
